    Create a daily learning plan for a user who wants to learn '{target}' in {time_in_days} days.
    Your response must be a valid JSON array.
    Each element in the array should be an object representing a single day's plan.
    Each daily object must have the following keys:
    - "day": An integer representing the day number (from 1 to {time_in_days}).
    - "topic": A concise string for the main topic of the day.
    - "details": A string providing a brief description of tasks or concepts for the day.
    - "status": A string, which must be initialized to "pending".

    Do not include any text or markdown formatting outside of the JSON array itself.
    Example for 1 day:
    [
      {{
        "day": 1,
        "topic": "Introduction to Python",
